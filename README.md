# Now You Can! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Read how below.

# Prerequisites:

- [graphviz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz)
- [colour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colour)
- [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)

# Generate From Example Data

move in the "example" folder and run python 

  ../src/graph.py

P.S.

Note that there is a lot of redundancy in the example data.
