Code for "Five Hundred Deep Learning Papers, Graphviz and Python" (http://bit.ly/500DLPapers)

WIP: There still is a lot of work to do here, stay tuned!

# Prerequisites:

- [graphviz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz)
- [colour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colour)
- [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)

For now you can move in the "example" folder and run python ../graph.py

Note that there is a lot of redundancy in the example data.
